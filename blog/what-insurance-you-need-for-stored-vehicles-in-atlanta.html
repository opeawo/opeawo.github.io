      <h1>What Insurance You Need for Stored Vehicles in Atlanta</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Here&#39;s something most people discover too late: storing your vehicle doesn&#39;t automatically mean your insurance still covers it, and your storage facility almost certainly isn&#39;t covering it either. The gap between what people assume and what&#39;s actually protected has cost vehicle owners thousands of dollars in uninsured losses.</p>
<h2>What Storage Facilities Actually Cover</h2>
<p>Almost nothing, in most cases.</p>
<p>Standard storage rental agreements explicitly disclaim liability for damage to or theft of your vehicle. Read the contract you signed (or will sign). There&#39;s nearly always language that says something like: &quot;Facility assumes no responsibility for loss or damage to stored property.&quot;</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t the facility being shady—it&#39;s standard industry practice. Storage facilities provide space, security measures, and access. They don&#39;t provide insurance coverage for your stuff.</p>
<p>Some facilities offer optional storage insurance as an add-on. This might cost $10-30/month and provide limited coverage (often $5,000-15,000) for theft or damage. It&#39;s better than nothing but usually doesn&#39;t provide full replacement value.</p>
<h2>What Your Auto Insurance Covers</h2>
<p>This is where it gets complicated. Coverage depends on:</p>
<p><strong>What type of policy you have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Liability only: Covers damage you cause to others, not your own vehicle. Provides zero protection for a stored vehicle.</li>
<li>Comprehensive coverage: Covers non-collision damage (theft, hail, fire, vandalism). This is what protects stored vehicles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy terms about vehicle use:</strong> Some policies require the vehicle to be used regularly (driven a certain number of miles) or stored at a specific location. Storing a car off-site for months without driving it might technically violate your policy terms, though this is rarely enforced.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Storage&quot; vs. &quot;registered&quot; status:</strong> Some states allow you to officially put a vehicle in &quot;storage&quot; status (suspended registration). Georgia doesn&#39;t have a formal storage status, so your vehicle should stay registered and insured to maintain coverage.</p>
<h2>The Common Scenarios</h2>
<h3>Scenario 1: Your car is stolen from storage</h3>
<p>Comprehensive coverage should cover this, minus your deductible. File a police report immediately, then a claim with your insurer. The storage facility&#39;s liability is typically zero unless you can prove gross negligence (they left the gate open overnight, etc.).</p>
<h3>Scenario 2: Hail damage while stored outside</h3>
<p>Comprehensive coverage handles this too. This is actually a common claim in Georgia—spring hailstorms can destroy cars in unprotected storage. Your deductible applies.</p>
<h3>Scenario 3: Someone hits your parked car</h3>
<p>If identifiable, the other party&#39;s liability insurance should cover it. If it&#39;s a hit-and-run, you&#39;d claim against your own collision coverage (if you have it) or uninsured motorist property damage coverage.</p>
<h3>Scenario 4: Vandalism</h3>
<p>Comprehensive covers vandalism. Again, the facility isn&#39;t liable unless they were negligent.</p>
<h3>Scenario 5: Fire destroys your vehicle</h3>
<p>Comprehensive covers fire. Whether the fire started from your vehicle, another vehicle, or the building doesn&#39;t matter for your coverage.</p>
<h2>RVs and Boats: Different Policies</h2>
<p>Standard auto insurance doesn&#39;t cover RVs or boats. You need:</p>
<p><strong>RV insurance:</strong> Similar structure to auto insurance (liability, collision, comprehensive) but specifically for motorhomes, fifth wheels, and travel trailers. Coverage for personal items inside the RV varies by policy.</p>
<p><strong>Boat insurance:</strong> Covers the hull, motor, and usually equipment. Some policies include liability for accidents on the water.</p>
<p>These policies have their own terms about storage. Some offer discounts when the RV or boat is in storage (since you&#39;re not using it and can&#39;t cause accidents). Others require notification when the vehicle enters long-term storage.</p>
<p>Read your policy or call your agent. RV and boat policies vary more than standard auto policies.</p>
<h2>How to Avoid Coverage Gaps</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep comprehensive coverage active</strong> — Dropping to liability-only while storing saves money but eliminates the coverage you actually need. The risk isn&#39;t from driving; it&#39;s from theft, weather, and vandalism.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Notify your insurer about storage</strong> — You don&#39;t have to, but it&#39;s worth doing. Some insurers offer storage discounts. At minimum, you&#39;ll have documentation that you informed them.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Verify the storage location is acceptable</strong> — Some policies require vehicles to be stored at your residence or a &quot;secured&quot; facility. Off-site storage is almost always fine, but confirming avoids potential disputes.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check facility insurance options</strong> — If your own coverage is limited, facility-provided insurance might fill gaps. It&#39;s usually not worth it if you have good comprehensive coverage.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Document vehicle condition before storage</strong> — Take dated photos and note mileage. If you need to file a claim, documentation helps establish the vehicle&#39;s pre-storage condition.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Review coverage limits</strong> — Make sure your policy limits are high enough to actually replace your vehicle. A 10-year-old truck needs less coverage than a new Class A motorhome.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Cost Equation</h2>
<p>Maintaining comprehensive coverage on a stored vehicle typically costs $20-50/month for cars, more for RVs and boats. That&#39;s $240-600/year for protection against events that could cost $10,000-100,000+ to fix.</p>
<p>People who drop coverage to save money are essentially betting nothing bad will happen. Sometimes they win that bet. Sometimes a hailstorm or theft changes the math dramatically.</p>
<h2>Oxford RV Storage and Insurance</h2>
<p>Oxford RV Storage provides secure storage, but like virtually all storage facilities, doesn&#39;t provide insurance for stored vehicles. The facility offers gated access, lighting, and security measures to reduce risk, but you&#39;re responsible for your own insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Before storing, confirm your insurance situation. Call your provider, review your policy, and make sure you&#39;re actually protected.</p>
