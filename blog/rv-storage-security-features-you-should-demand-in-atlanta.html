      <h1>RV Storage Security Features You Should Demand in Atlanta</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>RVs are valuable targets. A motorhome represents $50,000 to $500,000+ of investment sitting in a parking lot. The contents often include electronics, appliances, and personal items worth thousands more. When you&#39;re not watching, security features are all that stands between your RV and theft, vandalism, or damage.</p>
<p>Not all security is equal. Some features genuinely protect; others exist primarily for marketing. Understanding the difference helps you evaluate facilities based on what actually matters.</p>
<h2>Non-Negotiable Security Features</h2>
<p>These aren&#39;t &quot;nice to have&quot;—they&#39;re minimums for legitimate RV storage.</p>
<h3>Perimeter Fencing</h3>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>6+ feet tall (8 feet is better)</li>
<li>No gaps, sags, or damage</li>
<li>Extends completely around the property</li>
<li>Gates are solid and close properly</li>
<li>No easy climb-over points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Fencing establishes the boundary and creates a barrier to casual entry. It won&#39;t stop determined criminals, but it eliminates walk-in opportunists.</p>
<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Fencing with visible gaps, damaged sections not repaired, or areas where the fence doesn&#39;t connect to anything.</p>
<h3>Gated Access Control</h3>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Individual access codes or cards (not shared)</li>
<li>Gate closes promptly after each vehicle</li>
<li>Access log maintained</li>
<li>Former tenants&#39; access deactivated quickly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The gate controls who enters. Individual credentials mean every entry is logged and accountable. Shared codes spread uncontrollably and provide no audit trail.</p>
<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Shared gate codes (&quot;everyone uses 1234&quot;), gates that stand open, or broken gate mechanisms.</p>
<h3>Adequate Lighting</h3>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Coverage throughout the lot, not just near the office</li>
<li>Lights actually working (check for burned-out bulbs)</li>
<li>No large dark areas or shadowy corners</li>
<li>LED lights preferred (brighter, more reliable)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Criminals avoid well-lit areas. Good lighting also enables cameras to capture useful footage and makes evening visits feel safer.</p>
<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Large sections of the lot in darkness, many non-functioning lights, lighting only near the entrance.</p>
<h2>Important Security Features</h2>
<p>These aren&#39;t absolute requirements but significantly improve protection.</p>
<h3>Video Surveillance</h3>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cameras at gate, main aisles, and building entrances</li>
<li>Recording (not just live display)</li>
<li>Reasonable retention period (30+ days)</li>
<li>Night vision capability</li>
<li>Cameras positioned to capture useful detail (faces, plates)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Cameras deter (criminals see them) and document (footage aids investigation and prosecution). They don&#39;t actively prevent crime, but they provide accountability.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to ask:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Where are cameras positioned?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How long is footage retained?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Is it accessible if I report a problem?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Obvious dummy cameras, cameras that clearly don&#39;t function, or staff who can&#39;t answer basic questions about the system.</p>
<h3>Regular Management Presence</h3>
<p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On-site manager or regular staff visits</li>
<li>Visible activity during business hours</li>
<li>Responsiveness to issues and questions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Human presence deters crime and catches problems before they escalate. Someone who notices a broken fence section on Monday can fix it before Thursday&#39;s break-in.</p>
<p><strong>Red flag:</strong> Facility seems abandoned, no one answers calls, issues go unaddressed for weeks.</p>
<h2>Nice-to-Have Security Features</h2>
<p>These add protection but aren&#39;t essential for basic RV storage.</p>
<h3>Alarm Systems</h3>
<p>Some facilities have alarms on gates, buildings, or specific areas. Useful if monitored and responded to; less useful if they just make noise.</p>
<h3>On-Site Residence</h3>
<p>Facilities where a manager lives on-site get 24/7 human presence. More common at some RV parks that offer storage; less common at standard storage facilities.</p>
<h3>Monitored Security</h3>
<p>Active monitoring services that watch cameras in real-time and can call police during incidents. Rare at standard RV storage due to cost.</p>
<h2>Security Theater vs. Real Security</h2>
<h3>Marketing Claims to Scrutinize</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;24/7 Surveillance&quot;</strong> — Usually means cameras recording, not humans watching. Ask specifically what this means.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;State-of-the-Art Security&quot;</strong> — Vague and meaningless. Ask what specific features this refers to.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Fully Monitored&quot;</strong> — Could mean actively monitored by humans, or just that footage is recorded. Clarify.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Gated Community&quot;</strong> — A gate exists. Says nothing about whether it&#39;s effective or access is controlled.</p>
<h3>What Actually Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the gate close after vehicles enter?</li>
<li>Are access credentials individual and deactivated when people leave?</li>
<li>Can you see cameras and lights actually working?</li>
<li>Does the facility feel maintained and attended?</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust observation over marketing.</p>
<h2>Your Own Security Measures</h2>
<p>Facility security is the first layer. Add your own:</p>
<h3>For the RV</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hitch locks (fifth wheels, travel trailers)</li>
<li>Wheel locks (boots that immobilize the vehicle)</li>
<li>Steering wheel clubs (motorhomes)</li>
<li>GPS trackers (hidden, for recovery if stolen)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For Contents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t store high-value items in the RV long-term</li>
<li>Lock interior compartments</li>
<li>Remove electronics when possible</li>
<li>No visible valuables</li>
</ul>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Photograph your RV and contents with dates</li>
<li>Record serial numbers for expensive items</li>
<li>Know your VIN and keep it accessible</li>
<li>Have proof of ownership readily available</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evaluating Facilities</h2>
<h3>Before Signing</h3>
<ol>
<li>Visit in person (photos lie)</li>
<li>Walk the perimeter and check fence condition</li>
<li>Observe gate operation</li>
<li>Check lighting (visit in evening if possible)</li>
<li>Note camera positions</li>
<li>Ask direct security questions</li>
<li>Look at other vehicles stored (are owners trusting valuable rigs here?)</li>
</ol>
<h3>After Starting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Test your access credentials</li>
<li>Verify gate closes properly behind you</li>
<li>Report any security issues promptly</li>
<li>Monitor whether issues get addressed</li>
</ol>
