      <h1>Winter Boat Storage Guide for Atlanta Residents</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Georgia&#39;s winters are nothing like Minnesota&#39;s, which leads many Atlanta-area boat owners to skip winterization entirely. That&#39;s a mistake. While you don&#39;t need the aggressive prep required in hard-freeze states, Georgia&#39;s occasional sub-freezing temperatures can still crack blocks, destroy water pumps, and cause hundreds to thousands in damage if you&#39;re not prepared.</p>
<h2>Understanding Georgia Winter</h2>
<p>Atlanta&#39;s typical winter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average low temperatures: 30-35°F</li>
<li>Several nights per season dropping into the teens</li>
<li>Occasional hard freezes lasting 2-3 days</li>
<li>Extended cold snaps (multiple days below freezing) every 2-3 years</li>
</ul>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water in your boat&#39;s systems will freeze multiple times per winter</li>
<li>Even in &quot;mild&quot; Georgia, a single forgotten freeze can destroy components</li>
<li>You need freeze protection even if you don&#39;t need full northern winterization</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Needs Protection</h2>
<h3>Engine Cooling System</h3>
<p>This is the critical one. Water sits in your engine&#39;s cooling passages. When it freezes, it expands and cracks the engine block.</p>
<p><strong>Outboard motors:</strong> Raw water cooled. After flushing with fresh water, you must either drain all water from the powerhead or run RV antifreeze through the cooling system.</p>
<p><strong>Inboard/sterndrive:</strong> Have both raw water and closed cooling systems. The raw water side needs antifreeze; the closed side needs proper antifreeze mix (typically good to -34°F from the factory, but check).</p>
<p><strong>Jet drives:</strong> Similar to outboards—must be drained or flushed with antifreeze.</p>
<p><strong>The process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Flush the engine with fresh water</li>
<li>Attach &quot;muffs&quot; or use a fake-a-lake</li>
<li>Run the engine with RV antifreeze being drawn through the system</li>
<li>Continue until antifreeze exits the exhaust</li>
<li>Alternatively, drain all water (but flushing with antifreeze is more thorough)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fresh Water Systems</h3>
<p>If your boat has a freshwater system (sink, shower, livewell tanks):</p>
<ul>
<li>Drain all tanks</li>
<li>Run RV antifreeze through faucets until pink appears</li>
<li>Drain water heater if equipped</li>
<li>Add antifreeze to P-traps and drains</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sea Strainers and Through-Hulls</h3>
<p>Often overlooked. Water sits in these areas and can freeze.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drain sea strainers</li>
<li>Clear through-hull fittings</li>
<li>Some owners pour antifreeze through to be safe</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bilge</h3>
<p>Water accumulates in the bilge from various sources.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pump out the bilge completely</li>
<li>Pour some antifreeze into the bilge to protect any remaining water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fuel System Winterization</h2>
<h3>Stabilize the Fuel</h3>
<p>Gasoline degrades over winter, especially ethanol blends (which draw moisture).</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill the tank 90-95% full (prevents condensation but leaves room for expansion)</li>
<li>Add marine fuel stabilizer per instructions</li>
<li>Run the engine to circulate treated fuel through the system</li>
</ol>
<h3>Carbureted Engines</h3>
<p>If your boat has carburetors, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the carbs dry (turn off fuel, run until engine dies)</li>
<li>Drain carburetor bowls</li>
</ul>
<p>This prevents gummed-up carbs in spring.</p>
<h3>Fuel-Injected Engines</h3>
<p>Stabilizer and circulation is usually sufficient.</p>
<h2>Battery Care</h2>
<h3>Remove or Maintain</h3>
<p>Options:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Remove batteries, store indoors:</strong> Best protection. Use a maintainer.</li>
<li><strong>Leave in place with maintainer:</strong> Requires electrical access at storage.</li>
<li><strong>Disconnect and leave:</strong> Batteries will slowly discharge; may need charging in spring.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Cold temperatures reduce battery capacity. A battery that sat discharged all winter often won&#39;t recover fully. Proper maintenance extends battery life by years.</p>
<h2>Storage Location Options</h2>
<h3>On the Trailer at a Storage Facility</h3>
<p>Most common for Atlanta boaters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boat stays on its trailer</li>
<li>Trailer parked at a storage facility</li>
<li>Accessible when you want it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexible, affordable, boat is ready for spring <strong>Cons:</strong> Weather exposure unless covered, requires proper winterization</p>
<h3>Dry Stack Marina Storage</h3>
<p>If available at your marina:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boat stored in rack structure</li>
<li>Protected from most weather</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Better protection, no trailer needed <strong>Cons:</strong> Limited availability, higher cost, tied to one marina</p>
<h3>Home Storage</h3>
<p>If space and HOA allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep the boat at home</li>
<li>Easier to check and maintain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Free, convenient <strong>Cons:</strong> Takes up space, may not be allowed</p>
<h2>Cover the Boat</h2>
<p>A quality cover protects against:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debris accumulation</li>
<li>UV damage (even in winter)</li>
<li>Rain and moisture inside</li>
<li>Critter intrusion</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cover options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fitted canvas or vinyl cover with proper support</li>
<li>Shrink wrap (professional installation, good protection, one-time use)</li>
<li>Mooring cover (if your boat has one)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical:</strong> The cover must be supported to prevent water pooling. Pooled water tears covers and adds weight.</p>
<h2>The &quot;Georgia Gamble&quot; Problem</h2>
<p>Many Atlanta boaters skip winterization because &quot;it doesn&#39;t get that cold.&quot; Then one cold snap hits, and they&#39;re replacing a cracked block or water pump.</p>
<p><strong>The math:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Basic winterization cost: $100-200 DIY, $200-400 professional</li>
<li>Cracked engine block repair: $2,000-8,000+</li>
<li>New water pump: $200-500+</li>
</ul>
<p>Winterization is cheap insurance.</p>
<h2>Spring De-Winterization</h2>
<p>When you&#39;re ready to use the boat:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove cover and inspect</li>
<li>Check for any damage or pest intrusion</li>
<li>Reinstall batteries</li>
<li>Run fresh water through the antifreeze systems</li>
<li>Refill cooling systems if drained</li>
<li>Change oil and filter</li>
<li>Check all fluid levels</li>
<li>Test-run the engine before launching</li>
</ol>
<h2>Oxford RV Storage for Winter Boat Storage</h2>
<p>Oxford RV Storage accommodates boats on trailers for winter storage. The facility offers outdoor and covered options with gated access.</p>
<p>For boats stored through Georgia&#39;s winter, covered storage provides additional protection against debris and weather while your boat sits winterized. The facility is convenient for boaters who use Lake Oconee or other eastern Georgia waters.</p>
