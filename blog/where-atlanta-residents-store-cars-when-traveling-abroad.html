      <h1>Where Atlanta Residents Store Cars When Traveling Abroad</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>International travel from Atlanta—whether for work, study abroad, or extended vacation—creates a practical problem: what happens to your car while you&#39;re gone? You can&#39;t take it with you, and leaving it on the street or in an unsecured location for months is asking for trouble.</p>
<h2>The Options</h2>
<h3>Dedicated Vehicle Storage Facilities</h3>
<p>The most common solution for trips over 2-3 weeks. You rent a space at a storage facility, prep your car for extended sitting, and retrieve it when you return.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Secure, gated facilities</li>
<li>Designed for vehicles</li>
<li>Month-to-month flexibility</li>
<li>Various protection levels available</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Monthly cost ($50-200+ depending on facility and options)</li>
<li>Need to get to/from the facility on travel days</li>
<li>You&#39;re responsible for vehicle prep and maintenance</li>
</ul>
<h3>Friend or Family&#39;s Property</h3>
<p>If someone you trust has a garage, driveway, or secure space, this can be ideal.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Often free</li>
<li>Someone can check on the car</li>
<li>Can handle emergencies</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You&#39;re imposing on them</li>
<li>May not be secure</li>
<li>Not everyone has this option</li>
</ul>
<h3>Airport Long-Term Parking</h3>
<p>For shorter international trips (1-2 weeks), airport lots work. For longer trips, the math breaks down—$10-14/day × 30+ days gets expensive fast.</p>
<p><strong>Practical limit:</strong> Under 3 weeks. Beyond that, dedicated storage is cheaper.</p>
<h3>Home Storage (If Possible)</h3>
<p>If you have a garage or secure parking at home and someone to check on things, keeping the car at home makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have someone start it periodically</li>
<li>Make sure HOA/neighborhood rules allow long-term parking</li>
<li>Security varies by neighborhood</li>
</ul>
<h2>Before You Leave the Country</h2>
<h3>4-6 Weeks Before</h3>
<p><strong>Choose your storage option.</strong> Book a space if using a facility. Confirm with friends/family if using their property.</p>
<p><strong>Verify insurance coverage.</strong> Call your insurer to confirm your policy covers the car while:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stored off-property (if using a facility)</li>
<li>Undriven for extended periods</li>
<li>While you&#39;re out of the country</li>
</ul>
<p>Some policies have requirements about regular use or specific storage locations. Better to know now than after a claim.</p>
<h3>1-2 Weeks Before</h3>
<p><strong>Prepare the car:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full tank of gas + fuel stabilizer (if storing 30+ days)</li>
<li>Oil change if you&#39;re due within 3-6 months</li>
<li>Check tire pressure (add 3-5 PSI over normal)</li>
<li>Clean interior—remove all food, trash, valuables</li>
<li>Clean exterior—dirt trapped under covers damages paint</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Handle battery:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Option A: Disconnect battery</li>
<li>Option B: Install battery maintainer (need power access)</li>
<li>Option C: Have someone start it every 2 weeks (requires someone stateside)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take photos of the car&#39;s condition</li>
<li>Record mileage</li>
<li>Write down storage address, access code, space number</li>
<li>Share this info with someone you trust</li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel Day</h3>
<p><strong>Final steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lock everything</li>
<li>Cover the car if storing outdoors/covered</li>
<li>Test that your access code/key works</li>
<li>Take a final photo</li>
<li>Arrange transport to airport (Uber, friend, shuttle)</li>
</ul>
<h2>While You&#39;re Gone</h2>
<h3>Someone Stateside</h3>
<p>Ideally, you have someone who can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check on the car occasionally</li>
<li>Handle emergencies (storage facility issues, weather events)</li>
<li>Start the car periodically (if that&#39;s your battery plan)</li>
<li>Respond if you&#39;re contacted about the vehicle</li>
</ul>
<p>Give them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your storage details</li>
<li>Authorization letter to access the car</li>
<li>Your itinerary and emergency contact info</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Can Go Wrong</h3>
<p><strong>Battery dies:</strong> Very common. Either plan for it (maintainer/disconnection) or accept you might need a jump when you return.</p>
<p><strong>Weather event:</strong> Hail, flood, tornado. This is why insurance matters and why covered storage is worth considering.</p>
<p><strong>Facility issue:</strong> Rare, but facilities can have break-ins, fires, or closures. Your insurance should cover these scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Your trip extends:</strong> Make sure your storage is month-to-month or that you can pay remotely if you stay longer than planned.</p>
<h2>Returning to Atlanta</h2>
<h3>Immediate Return</h3>
<p>If you land at Hartsfield-Jackson and head straight to your storage facility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow time—you&#39;ll be jet-lagged</li>
<li>Consider whether driving immediately is wise</li>
<li>Have your access code ready</li>
<li>Expect to need a jump start</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next-Day Retrieval</h3>
<p>Often smarter to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uber home from the airport</li>
<li>Sleep in your own bed</li>
<li>Retrieve the car when you&#39;re functional</li>
</ol>
<h3>Post-Storage Checks</h3>
<p>Before driving normally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check tire pressure</li>
<li>Look under the car for leaks</li>
<li>Check oil level</li>
<li>Let the car idle for 5-10 minutes before driving</li>
<li>Listen for unusual sounds</li>
<li>Check brakes carefully on first drive (surface rust is normal, should burn off quickly)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Oxford RV Storage for Travelers</h2>
<p>Oxford RV Storage works for international travelers who live on the east side of the Metro or whose departure doesn&#39;t involve the airport. The facility offers month-to-month storage, which matches the often-uncertain timelines of international travel.</p>
<p>For travelers flying out of Hartsfield-Jackson, the 45-mile distance from Oxford means you&#39;d need to arrange transport to/from the airport. This isn&#39;t ideal for short trips but matters less for months-long travel where the storage cost savings outweigh the inconvenience.</p>
