      <h1>Winterizing Your RV or Boat in Georgia</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
<p>Georgia isn&#39;t Minnesota. Your RV or boat doesn&#39;t need the same aggressive winterization that northern owners perform. But Georgia also isn&#39;t Florida—we get cold snaps that dip into the teens, and a single hard freeze can crack pipes, destroy water heaters, and ruin pumps in vehicles that weren&#39;t prepared.</p>
<p>The key is understanding what Georgia winters actually require: protection against occasional hard freezes, not months of sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<h2>Georgia&#39;s Winter Reality</h2>
<p>Atlanta typically sees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average winter lows in the low-to-mid 30s°F</li>
<li>2-5 nights per winter below 20°F</li>
<li>Occasionally, nights in the single digits or teens</li>
<li>Rare but possible extended cold snaps (2-4 days below freezing)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means water in unprotected systems will freeze multiple times per winter. You don&#39;t need full winterization for the entire season, but you need protection against those freeze events.</p>
<h2>RV Winterization Options</h2>
<h3>Option 1: Full Winterization</h3>
<p>Drain all water, run RV antifreeze through the entire plumbing system, bypass the water heater, drain holding tanks.</p>
<p><strong>When this makes sense:</strong> You&#39;re storing the RV from November through March and don&#39;t plan to use it at all. You&#39;d rather do it once and forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Drain fresh water tank completely</li>
<li>Drain and bypass water heater (never put antifreeze in the water heater)</li>
<li>Run RV antifreeze through all faucets, toilets, showers until pink antifreeze appears</li>
<li>Add antifreeze to holding tanks to protect drain valves</li>
<li>Drain black and gray tanks if possible</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $10-15 for antifreeze if DIY; $100-150 at a service center</p>
<h3>Option 2: Drain-Only</h3>
<p>Drain all water and leave faucets open. No antifreeze, just empty systems.</p>
<p><strong>When this makes sense:</strong> You might use the RV on a warm weekend and don&#39;t want to purge antifreeze. You&#39;re willing to monitor weather and re-drain if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Drain fresh water tank and water heater</li>
<li>Open all faucets</li>
<li>Run water pump briefly to clear lines</li>
<li>Leave faucets cracked open so any residual water can drain</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Small amounts of water in low points or p-traps can still freeze. Works for mild freezes; risky for hard freezes.</p>
<h3>Option 3: Heated Storage or Active Monitoring</h3>
<p>Keep the RV heated during cold snaps, or monitor temps and winterize only when freezes are forecast.</p>
<p><strong>When this makes sense:</strong> You use the RV year-round and want to keep it ready. You have electricity at your storage location.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Requires power, costs money to heat, and only works if you&#39;re monitoring forecasts.</p>
<h2>Boat Winterization in Georgia</h2>
<p>Boats have different systems but similar vulnerabilities. Key areas:</p>
<h3>Engine</h3>
<p>Outboard motors and stern drives have water in them after running. That water freezes.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Flush the engine with fresh water (especially if used in salt or brackish water)</li>
<li>Run the engine with antifreeze flowing through the cooling system (using muffs/fake-a-lake with antifreeze)</li>
<li>OR drain water and fog the engine with storage spray</li>
</ol>
<p>Inboard engines require more extensive winterization—consult your manual or a marine mechanic.</p>
<h3>Water Systems</h3>
<p>If your boat has a freshwater system (sink, shower, livewell):</p>
<ol>
<li>Drain all tanks</li>
<li>Run RV antifreeze through faucets</li>
<li>Add antifreeze to bilge if water collects there</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fuel System</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill the tank to prevent condensation</li>
<li>Add fuel stabilizer</li>
<li>Run engine to circulate treated fuel</li>
</ol>
<h3>Battery</h3>
<p>Remove and store indoors, or use a maintainer if leaving installed.</p>
<h2>The &quot;Georgia Gamble&quot; That Ruins Things</h2>
<p>Many Georgia RV and boat owners skip winterization because &quot;it doesn&#39;t get that cold here.&quot; Then one night hits 15°F when they weren&#39;t watching forecasts, and they&#39;re replacing a water heater, pump, and cracked pipes.</p>
<p>The damage from one hard freeze often exceeds $500-2,000 on an RV and can be even more on boats with complex cooling systems.</p>
<p>Full winterization costs $10-150 depending on DIY vs professional. The math is obvious.</p>
<h2>Timing for Georgia</h2>
<p><strong>Early-to-mid November:</strong> Start thinking about winterization if you&#39;re storing through winter. First hard freezes typically come late November through December.</p>
<p><strong>Before extended travel:</strong> If you&#39;re leaving the RV in storage while traveling for the holidays, winterize before you go. Don&#39;t trust the forecast—weather can change.</p>
<p><strong>Before any forecast below 25°F:</strong> If you&#39;re using the drain-only approach, verify your RV is fully drained before any significant freeze.</p>
<h2>De-Winterizing in Spring</h2>
<p>Georgia&#39;s last freeze risk runs through mid-March in most areas. When you&#39;re ready to use your RV or boat again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drain antifreeze from the system</li>
<li>Close any open faucets</li>
<li>Fill fresh water tank</li>
<li>Run all faucets until water runs clear (no pink antifreeze)</li>
<li>Flush the water heater</li>
<li>Sanitize the system with diluted bleach solution, then flush thoroughly</li>
</ol>
<h2>Oxford RV Storage and Winterization</h2>
<p>Oxford RV Storage stores RVs and boats through the winter months. The facility provides secure storage, but winterization is the owner&#39;s responsibility.</p>
<p>Many owners winterize before storing in November and de-winterize when they retrieve vehicles in spring. If you need winterization services, local RV and marine service centers in the Covington and Conyers areas offer this work.</p>
